# Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run it: `npm install` then `npm run start`.

# TODO

- ~~Add validation to creation form~~
- ~~Add propTypes~~
- Add ability to add notes from grid view
- Remove moment for something like https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns so I don't have to deal with ejecting webpack config for the locale fix
- More accessibility improvements (high contrast mode?)
- Split out habit notes into separate component - look for other places to do same
- Add help text/about info - to creation screen and grid view
- Add build directory and build as Chrome extension
- Write tests
- Bonus: color themes
